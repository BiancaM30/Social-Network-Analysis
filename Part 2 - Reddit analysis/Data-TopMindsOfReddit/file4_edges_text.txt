1 22 0.9976667165756226 Jumping in to pick a few things apart here:

>punk, emo, satanist, bdsm/ddlg or goth...teenage rebel or wannabe aristocrat

There's uh...a whole lot of different interest/identity groups there, some of which overlap and some of which very much do *not*. So if you're just piling all things you don't like together then yeah, you're going to be losing a lot of people.

>Aspiring influencer...taking pictures of their food or the tourist sections they visit when they go to other countries

So yeah, I think that influencer culture and allowing people to gain notoriety in that way was a mistake...but also, when I eat somewhere nice or go somewhere I've never been, I want to take photos to remember the beautiful things. And it kind of seems like he's judging *anyone* who does that.

>Meme

What

>Have no greater ambitions or creativity other than going to college, getting a job, and starting a family

This was never really my vibe and I've definitely been in social settings with people who I've wondered like...what do they think about on a day-to-day basis. However, you get the fuck over it. If all somebody wants to do is get an education and a job that pays for them to be comfortable so that they can share in the love of a spouse and children...there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

In addition, what does he mean there's no LGBTQ community, that it's a "lie"? Like the existence of Pride alone, which if Peterson knows *nothing else* about the LGBTQ+ population he's definitely aware of Pride, is enough to recognize that there's a community there. 

Semi-related: several weeks ago I commented about Peterson being a hack on an Instagram reel of his debate with Destiny and I'm still getting multiple replies a *day* from his followers telling me I'm an idiot who isn't smart enough to understand him (I have a PhD, not that it necessarily matters because Peterson is proof it doesn't matter).

I bring that up because then I see a "penned" tweet like this, and this all-meat-diet word salad is the best shit that their idol can come up with?

We get in arguments over stupid bullshit on the internet.

Nobody wants to do that in real life other than your one friend who is or is striving to be a lawyer.

I have acquaintances in real life who hate Taylor Swift because she is a psyop. They aren't my closest friends, but they are, more or less "friends." They are mostly good people with a couple of crazy beliefs. That's how it literally works in real life. As long as they aren't forcing their beliefs on me, it's whatever. I have some crazy beliefs that I keep to myself. We all do.

The only reason I know they don't like TSwift is because we were in a car together and a TSwift song came on and they asked me to change it. That specific situation just doesn't come up often enough IRL for me to care, and they asked me to change the radio. They didn't demand it, or change it themselves. Good people, some crazy beliefs.

This was how friendships happened pre-internet.

"Guys, the government is funding your schools! But also the schools are really being run by the taxpayer! I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOVERNMENT IS!"

It's also funny how they're like "Well the shitpost is \*technically\* incorrect..." No, honey. It's incorrect in every sense. Public schools ARE open to the public (it's in the name) and are indeed held "accountable"(?) to the public.

Dickhead's lying, because they seem to love pretending to be former left-leaning voters who were "forced" to become far-right cunts because of some bullshit.

Like how "30p" Lee Anderson MP said that he was going to vote against a Conservative Party bill (back before he defected to the even further-right Reform Party when even his racism against Labour politician/London Mayor Sadiq Khan was too much for the Conservatives), but then he saw his former Labour Party colleagues - yes, Lee had defected from Labour to Conservative, prior - laughing at him.

So then he walked out and went into the "yes" room to *support* the bill, instead.

That's the kind of mentality we're dealing with.

1 312 0.9949407577514648 God, I hate this fucking narrative. Love thy neighbor for me means not to infect them with a potenitally lethal virus if I can help it. I probably talked more with my neighbors during Covid than ever before. I live in an apartment complex and we had people posting notes with their phone numbers, offering to go grocery shopping for people who were ill or had to quarantine. If you met someone outside, you'd stop to ask how they were doing, from a safe distance. 

People weren't afraid of their neighbors, they were, if that, afraid to get infected, or to infect other vulnerable people. That's why they wore masks and got vaccinated. But I didn't see those people whine every day about how they feared the virus or anything.

The people who were constantly afraid of all kinds of BS were people like OOP. They were afraid of masks, of tyranny, of vaccinations, of bioweapons, of 15-minute-cities, 5G, doctors, ventilators and hospitals. They were afraid enough to medicate themselves with Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine, there were people who drank bleach! Apparently, they were so traumatized that they still can't stop talking about it.

I believe Catherine, the Princess of Wales is one of them.  You can look at the fact that she was naturally slender but not thin in her youth and she looked healthy to the later Princess years where  her bones were prominent and she did not look natural in her thinness.

It’s a sad commentary on society tbh that she felt the need to do so.

Thinking she is secretly a man, however, is laughable.

1 84 0.9882593154907227 That bothers me so much, do they think straight couples have enlightened reasons they get into relationships? 

Straight couples: enjoy each other's company, want to share lives, physical attraction leads to sex which could maybe lead to pregnancy.

Gay couples: enjoy each other's company, want to share lives, physical attraction leads to sex.

So the main sticking point is how babies get made? Babies are cool but if I wanted to I could make anyone interested in going through birth sound like they were gross...

1 394 0.9983559250831604 One of, if not THE worst thing that American politicians ever did was embrace the idea that "the government" is some sort of "other" to be vilified and demonized. It's a bi-partisan ideal to paint the government as bad, too.

As opposed to the actual American ideal of government "OF the people, BY the people, and FOR the people"

Just another ideal to be disposed of like that whole "all men created equal" thing.....

>They aren't accountable to the public

Do you think if a Muslim wanted to teach the Quaran in a public school that Corey A. DeAngelis would support them? What if a trans person wanted more trans-inclusive history taught? Or someone who didn't speak English wanted classes taught in other languages? 

Somehow, I don't think so.

The American public can be Muslim, trans, non-English speaking, and many other things. But those types of people rarely seem to be included in "the public". When people like Corey A DeAngelis, adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, talks about "the American people", I'm guessing he thinks that there's only one volk that really counts.

1 456 0.9939739108085632 I'm always confused by the American usage of the word "government". Most of what is called government there is called the equivalent of "state" in Germany, or some form thereof (like staatlich -- belonging to the state). Police, public libraries, welfare, local bureaucrats, public transport, tax agencies, the judicial system, food inspections, … that's all part of the state, but it's not the government. The government is what we elect every couple of years to pass laws.

Aren’t they? Anyone can run for a position on the school board. Parents and the public at large have an *excessive* amount of influence on school policies. 

We’ve seen book bans, curriculum changes, and straight up harassment campaigns against faculty directly because of “the public”.

Jesus, all they do is lie.
1 460 0.997506320476532 >”Hence someone with much more money than college students is funding the protests”

Like, these folks can look up the tent pretty easily. It’s an Ozark Trail 3-person tent, or one very similar to it. It’s literally $29.97 on Walmart’s website, and it’s the *cheapest* tent you can buy (the next one up is $70) - which is probably why it’s the one that was chosen.  College students are generally poor as hell, sure, but I’m fairly certain most of them can swing $30.

Also, no, it doesn’t come in a “variety of colours”. It only comes in one color because, again, it’s the cheapest tent you can buy.

I remember hearing people around me talking about it being hard for them to get approved for adoption because they were a gay couple and if they did it was only special needs kids they were approved for because they were hard to place in homes.

 So after that I started hearing stories of some getting IVF and other couples finding a surrogate because they were having difficulty being approved for adoption. This was at least 10+ years ago that these conversations were happening.

I can’t believe these perverts just put all this obscenity absolutely everywhere I look. They even do it in my own house. Vases? Basically just Nubian fertility goddesses. Lightbulbs? Come on. But worst of all, hotdogs. I would rather die than eat a hotdog.
1 586 0.9952044486999512 honestly, that was the first thing I thought. Problem is that these ppl think it's 1) bad/harmful and 2) connect it to a hateful ideology to bash minorities.

1 587 0.9955418705940247 Alright, ok. Let's bite and say it's a conspiracy.

Why?

What would you achieve by putting chairs that very remotely look phallic under a specific angle, in a children's section of the library?

As if children and teenagers didn't draw dicks on every available surface anyway?
1 133 0.012882888317108154 Since they said it I can definitely see how it looks like genitalia, but otherwise I never would have made that connection. They think about dicks more often before breakfast than I do in an entire week and that’s not a topic I shy away from.
1 133 0.9987278580665588 If someone starts with a premise of “the world shouldn’t care about poor people, survival of the fittest” you can just cut the conversation there. There’s no point in a conversion with someone who doesn’t take “people being happy is good” as a premise. 

That said, even a full selfish libertarian type should be in favor of some sort form of welfare or aid for the poor because you need that for a functioning economy with workers. I guess the fact that this might involve some *undesirables* being helped overrides their selfishness.

1 717 0.0031705498695373535 It's honestly a little impressive how long the right has been able to maintain the "trans the gay away" conspiracy theory, considering how it contradicts most other anti-trans narratives. It's like, "the trans are predatory straight men who want access to women, but also they're hapless homosexuals who've been forced to transition. The trans are anarchists trying to tear down all traditional notions of sex and gender, but also they're arch conservatives obsessed with making everyone live by antiquated gender norms".

Do they just turn off the chemtrails once they hit the state border, and turn them back on afterwards? And TN has obviously investigated the planes at all of their airports and removed the offending instruments, right? And they've spoken with the airport maintenance staff who would have to upkeep the devices and refill them with chemicals? Or did the (((Globalists))) sneak in to uninstall them and wipe everyone's memories first knowing that this law would pass? OR was it actually their plan the whole time to allow this law to pass, if they didn't craft it themselves in a 4D chess maneuver??

4 31 0.9971447587013245 >What is with right wingers and conspiracy morons who think that it sounds really smart to talk in riddles, like it has meaning?

  
I have various theories. First of all, conspiracists tend to try to convince people using the same phrases used to "convince" them. And since they most likely read or heard a conspiracy from a grifter they use their same language. And grifters are all like "I'll talk to you in riddles, "just asking questions" so you "make your own conclusions" so that in case you do something stupid I'm legally protected". So they, too talk in nonsense riddles and "just asking questions!".

Second, conspiracies are always based on religions, cults and superstitions. So they tend to copy the mystical, wisemen-kind of rhetoric from these.

And finally, and I'm more inclined towards this one. Conspiracists have a lot of trouble in building their sentences and ordering their thoughts before they speak/write. So what we read is them actually going through their train of thought as they write. That's why they often change subject drastically, speak in short bursts and refer to the mystical. They speak exactly how they think

8 321 0.9951143264770508 I recently watched [this video](https://youtu.be/6i91PzpWDAM) which made me think this is a legitimate issue with some gay people, desperate for the mainstream to tolerate them, being angry at trans people for seeming less "normal" and making all LGBT people seem less acceptable by connotation—rather than straight people pretending to be gay to attack trans people.
8 207 0.7583516240119934 Often enough probably.  Ten percent of any group is a totally trash person you wouldn't spit on if it was raining.  Online that adds up to a lot of people.

Every survey or bit of informal research I've seen so far shows support for trans people in the 80 to 95% range for other LBGTQ+ people generally; only gay men seem to be a little bit lower, probably because they're men.  (I haven't seen anything that splits bi people by gender; I'm assuming better numbers for bi men than gay men because of the constant invalidation bi people get giving us a little more solidarity with other people who are also not believed to be what we say we are, but I can't be sure.)

NBC, CBS, CNN, even PBS all ran pieces and segments about Biden poking the orange monster right in the eye and publicly humiliating him with that. It even dislodged the New York trial from being top news for a few hours.

What more do you want?

Like when they ran stories about Biden's age constantly for months, or act as though Biden's just as bad as Trump, or refuse to report on the things he's done in three years that have broken records.

It's insane how much corporate media reports on everything Trump does, pushes his lies about rally sizes and other things, and then doesn't counter that with positives about Biden and his government.

It's got to a point that I - a Brit - have resorted to watching Meidas Touch videos on YouTube to find out what Biden and Trump are doing because they actually present a balanced and fair representation of what both men are doing, and informing me about things Joe Biden is doing that CNN, MSNBC, etc haven't even touched.

18 351 0.9946722388267517 He was *always* like that from the second he took control of the top mod position. The slightest hint of criticism of Trump and Republicans, or even the *assumption* of it, was all it took to earn a perma-ban from him.

It's "better" now in that dissenting takes are kinda mostly allowed as long as they're not *too* critical of the sub's favorite religion, party, leader, or foreign sugar daddies that axo conditioned them to have blind loyalty for.

Still wild to think how much that sub has changed. I first joined Reddit in 2007, right after the HD-DVD key revolt on Digg, and while I was around for the birth of that sub, I rarely spent much time there, *but* it was a hell of a lot different. Back then, like most of Reddit, organized religion was not popular on r/conspiracy, and any Jesus talk was usually met with scorn, and before Obama's election, saying Bush and Republicans orchestrated 9/11 was wildly common since there was no blind loyalty to politicians or a political party. 

The Obama years is when the sub's "ideologies" really took a dive, helped mostly by Alex Jones being their god long before Trump announced his candidacy. That's when the racism *really* started becoming clearer, with Birthers finding a new home there. After that, it didn't take long for the antisemitism to really explode. So by the time Trump was announcing his candidacy in 2015 and espousing many of the conspiracies they'd been sharing for years, they were *primed* to worship a demagogue that spoke their bat-shittery. 

That's why all the claims about r/conspiracy only going downhill after T_D was banned is just pure whitewashing of the sub's history. It was T_D 2.0 by the time the DNC leaks were spreading across the internet, and stayed that way regardless of T_D's continued existence for nearly the rest of his administration. The crossover of users between T_D and r/conspiracy was way too obvious to believe T_D regulars only moved there *after* T_D was banned.

18 650 0.9994113445281982 > To be fair, it’s kinda weird that Reddit works like that. 

It's not really that weird. No moderators should have the power to completely delete someone's posts/comments from their account. 

If that was ever the case, a whole *bunch* of shit on Reddit never would've been seen by anyone else; imagine how terribly that "power" would've been used by T_D's mods. Yeah, they couldn't have used it anywhere outside of the sub, but with how much the moderators of the laughably-described "last bastion of free speech on Reddit" abused their mod powers, there'd have been nothing but [removed] graveyards on almost every post there. 

The admins having that power makes sense since they're *running* Reddit, A post/comment removed by Reddit *really* removes it unless someone got an archive of it before the removal came. 

>Of course, they’re still being consistent in that they’re wrong, but still

If it's some alternate history with a black Washington? Go for it, but I do have have a problem with documentaries claiming to be historically accurate when they cast people of the wrong ethnicity. 

That goes both ways with things like native Americans being played by white people which bugs me just as much as Cleopatra being miscast.

Because why does everyone have to claim Egypt?  Do a documentary about Nubia and the actual black pharaohs. It's sad they get ignored. They were just as powerful and impressive as the Egyptians.

I was replying to this part. the ancien egyptians weren’t white as snow. you can even see that in their hieroglyphs and paintings
21 28 0.982998788356781 But they weren't black either. Though there were definitely black egyptians, and there were white ones too. It was a melting pot like modern America. They painted themselves red while painting Nubians black. They likely looked pretty similar to modern Egyptians, but more brown. 

Both sides arguing that they were only  white or black are wrong which is what I'm trying to explain. Besides ancient people didnt really have a modern concept of race as we do.

There's also no paradox in hating Jewish people in general but supporting Israel. You just have to hate Israel's victims more.
21 695 0.9896893501281738 I know, but Republicans are making bills to say that any criticism of Israel is anti semetic while they simultaneously promote anti semetic conspiracy theories. They then accuse the left of being anti semetic while refusing to call out people like MTG..

26 202 0.9312966465950012 It has far more to do with the rise of the internet than "America First".

Reactionary outcry at minorities in film (and stage plays, as this example is) was contained to individuals, but the internet has provided a way for those individuals to connect with each other and amplify their reactionarism.

Also, how many people even knew that a Much Ado About Nothing adaptation was happening, let alone that it featured a black actor? Much much fewer than would know that a Romeo and Juliet adaptation is being staged with a black actress now, because there weren't reactionary internet spaces and anti-sjw content creators that almost exclusively focus on these news stories for ragebait clicks. It's not like 99% of people commenting on this story are personally interested in Shakespearean adaptations and would have known about THIS casting if it wasn't for their racist online communities spamming about it.

If we had today's internet in 1993, there would definitely have been a noticable outrage at Denzel's casting as well.

28 204 0.10412091016769409 ”In order for a propaganda campaign to succeed, it needs a Big Lie. At Evergreen, the Big Lie is that Evergreen’s Day of Absence demonstrated “reverse racism” as whites “were forced to leave campus because of the color of their skin.” It is stunning to us how often this “alternative fact” has been repeated until it has become unchallenged truth. The truth is that the Day of Absence has long been an accepted — and voluntary — practice at Evergreen. On the Day of Absence, people of color who chose to do so generally attended an off-campus event, while whites who chose to participate stayed on campus to attend lectures, workshops and discussions about how race and racism shape social structures and everyday life. Many classes embraced the opportunity of Day of Absence to focus attention on how racism has impacted their own disciplines. For instance: a scientist might choose to address how race has historically and inaccurately been traced to genetic differences. A filmmaker might look at the histories of exclusion of people of color from mainstream filmmaking, or cultural stereotypes of race. The Day of Absence follows an important tradition of caucusing, in which people who share a common identity find value in creating autonomous space to share experiences. At Evergreen the Day of Absence is always followed by a Day of Presence where people have the opportunity to reconnect to the larger community by participating in shared learning activities, including a keynote speaker, a performance, and workshops.

Last spring the organizers switched the two events; the *event* for students of color was held on-campus, and the *event* for white students was held off-campus. As always, participation *in some form* was assumed, but attendance at the events was voluntary; the announcement to the campus read, “On Day of Absence, you can choose how and where to participate.” Nevertheless, faculty member Bret Weinstein denounced it on the faculty listserv, arguing that the college was engaging in “a show of force” and that whites were being coerced to leave campus. Although numerous colleagues attempted to show Weinstein that he was mistaken, he persisted, urging the college to “set phenotype aside.” 

Evergreen’s Director of First Peoples Multicultural Advising Services invited Weinstein to discuss and clarify the purpose of Day of Absence, but he never responded. As Evergreen professor Jon Davies put it in the *Seattle Times*, the Day of Absence is “always voluntary, always something people could participate in or not. To characterize it as mandated? It’s very hard to mandate anybody to do anything on this campus.” 

On the April 12 Day of Absence, the off-campus event took place at a local church which had space for only 200 people. Since the white student body numbers about 2,800, it was obvious that more than 90 percent of white students would not be able to attend. Not all people of color chose to attend the on-campus event either. Many faculty who understood the principle of caucusing found ways instead to incorporate the discussions into their class themes. For example, a class on natural disasters watched documentaries on the history of racism, and discussed how racism contributed to the damage caused by disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.

“Reverse racism” against whites (like “states’ rights”) has long been a key trope used to critique civil rights. Weinstein was espousing an ideology of “color-blindness” that denies the depths of racism in our society. H. Richard Milner IV, director of the Center for Urban Education at the University of Pittsburgh, explains that “color blindness” on the part of college faculty and staff contributes to “opportunity gaps,” as key parts of students’ identities and experiences go unseen. Weinstein’s opposition to the Day of Absence was part of his continuing campaign against the college’s equity emphasis, including our Equity Council’s proposal to prioritize the needs of struggling students of color and first-generation students. 

When the Council made a mild suggestion that the college should actively recruit faculty (of any race) with the knowledge and skills to teach about race, Weinstein commented, “In order to find professors who are good at what we Evergreen professors do, we need the largest pool of applicants possible. If we are prioritizing race over everything else, we would succeed in finding those unusual professors much less often.” Essentially debunking affirmative action, Weinstein’s stance, similar to the Trump administration’s insistence that affirmative-action “discriminates” against whites in universities, ignored the history of exclusion of people of color from faculty positions, and failed to explain why faculty of color would not be equally adept at the teaching Evergreen values.

The misleading claim that the Day of Absence was “reverse racism” caused confusion on campus. Some faculty believed Weinstein’s claims of coercion, or out of a sense of humility or guilt they stayed away from campus, or suggested that their white students stay away. This confusion confirms one of the problems identified by our Equity Council: many faculty whose disciplines do not include extensive examination of race and culture sometimes lack the tools to address these issues in the classroom. (Imagine if a social scientist had started aggressively denying that humans cause climate change, and other social scientists found they were ill-equipped to address such denial in their classrooms.) The Council proposed that faculty trainings would deepen understanding of racism’s underlying institutional structures, rather than viewing it as merely individual guilt or “prejudice” that can be overcome with an “I don’t see color” reaction. Trainings would offer opportunities to listen to faculty, staff, and students who have studied or lived these realities for years or decades.”

32 223 0.994090735912323 There's always an undercurrent of meanness to a lot of conservative humor.  It makes jokes that might have been funny just hit wrong.  Dave Chappelle's humor started out subversive but when he came back a lot of it came off as angry and mean.  The crux of conservative humor is punching down and it's only funny to a small, rather vile, group of people.

Broaching sensitive topics will always carry the risk of offending someone.  The best comedians can hit those topics without making people feel bad.
32 223 0.016869962215423584 I think there’s a bit of a hint of money spoiling comedy.

Good comedians who understand how the world works for the average person can craft hilarious jokes that hit with audiences who have similar experiences. 

Comedians like Chappelle and Seinfeld, who are multimillionaires, no longer understand what it’s like to struggle to survive in 2024 and can’t make jokes that the average person can identify with because their kids go to private schools, they drive three different cars, they get free meals at fancy restaurants, and praise every time they appear in public.

It’s hard to craft jokes the average person can identify with once you’ve gone full “I’M RICH, BEEYATCH!!”

Bourgeois comedians aren’t funny to proletariat audiences because they don’t craft jokes for us.

Seinfeld can’t identify with the average person today. What observational humor is he going to point out that most of us have gone through?

*Both the nanny and the landscaper took today off. What’s the deal with May 1st? It’s like it’s International Workers’ Day off. People just decide to take a day off? What’s the deal with that? Am I getting older or are people getting lazier?*

Just that they never did or intent on doing those things. They also know that these things are stored and displayed behind protective glass, so the only thing they did was generate a bunch of publicity and disrupt people. And that is exactly what the point of a protest is.

We also had game nights online with friends in other states, which we haven't done now in 2 years.

I gotta say, that was one of the things I miss most about that period: just chilling outside with people, taking bike rides, going camping together frequently.

The thing that absolutely enrages me is the continual defense of Stellar Blade that they fall back on is the main character is based on a body scan of a real human.

I refuse to believe people are that stupid. OK, well I refuse to believe *all* of the people saying that are that stupid.

They fucking *know* how body scans and mocapping works on a CG model. They *know* that's not how she literally looks in real life.

We have *all* made a character in a character creator and have had fun with the boob slider. If you are a gamer, you have played with the boob slider. We have all done that. Stop being disingenuous. It's so stupid and enraging.
38 412 0.6494250893592834 Congratulations. You asphyxiated (assphyxiated? nah. Too easy) Quiet. 

Seriously though, my eyes roll to the back of my head every time somebody says that Quiet isn't just wearing an... assault bikini? for the T and A titulation because that's how she breathes guys.

Do they realize this is a work of fiction? Hideo Kojima didn't *have* to create a character with a ridiculous plot contrivance  for why she wears a battle bikini.

Don't get me wrong. I like Quiet. I tolerate the titulation, but don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining. We know why she wears a tactical 2 piece.

and it doesn't sound like it's your thing, but my SO loves reading and she is always looking for more book porn.

Do you have any book names to recommend my SO?

38 432 0.012364804744720459 "Based on a real woman" is as truthful as "Based on a true story."  They just kept the breasts of the woman they scanned and changed everything else.
38 432 0.007851600646972656 Eve's boobs are way bigger and perkier and gravity defyinger than the model's.

Granted, the RL model is pretty busty but Eve is a completely different level, and especially gravity defying.

When men don't understand that boobs are supposed to disappear when a woman is on her back... I don't even know what to say.
38 432 0.9964229464530945 I stand corrected, though that doesn't really change my point, does it?
38 432 0.9972694516181946 I wasn't arguing your point. I just want everybody to be aware that Eve is not anything close to what a real person looks like.

In fact, I think she looks kind of grotesque. Have you accidentally clicked on an image and it's some hentai of a woman with 300 lb boobs or a dude with a 5 foot long dick?

I get it. That's somebody's fetish, and it's whatever, but most people find that grotesque.

Eve, to me, is *right* at that boob/butt uncanny valley.
38 432 0.0006823539733886719 More than fair.
38 87 0.9925504922866821 Maybe if Eve had an actual character, people might have liked her more. Similar to 2B or Bayonetta.
38 187 0.9916309714317322 I don't think I've ever *seen* a boob slider tbh
38 187 0.9819062948226929 I was being a little hyperbolic and facetious with the literal "boob slider."

Some games do have a literal boob slider, but almost every game with a character creator has some way to increase chest/waist/lower body (butt) sizes, for males and females. They might not be called "the boob slider," but the actual act of increasing or decreasing the size of ones chest/waist/lower body generally is increasing the size of one's boobs, or pecs for men, waist, butt, thighs, etc. etc.

and my specific point was how drastically you can shift a base CG model's appearance in a video game. Making "based on a real person" basically meaningless. 

Even Dark Souls 1, a game that came out 13 years ago? IIRC? Doesn't have a "boob slider," but you can make your females (and males) top heavy, bottom heavy, petite, thiiiick, etc. etc.
38 433 0.9003598690032959 Before I get called a coomer or an incel (which really sells the point that the arguments against Eve are coming from a positive place, and not just hate for the "other side"), I wanna say that I really DGAF about the game either way. But, since when is it a requirement in games for the characters to be realistic?

Plus, aren't the arguments about her being based on a RL model just in opposition to critics' outcries about how she isn't realistic? Seems like a chicken or the egg thing to me, but I really haven't paid much attention to the discourse, so I could be wrong.

I just don't understand why anyone cares that much about it, but I'm way more confused about the motivation of the those who are attacking the people that care about the censorship. I guess if I had to pick which side had more of a legit complaint, it'd be the side that bought an M rated game to fap to (weird stance, I know lol).
38 433 0.005695164203643799 This is very important that you understand this.

I am not saying she *should* look like a real person.

I am saying she does not look like a real person. I have no problem with her not looking like a real person. I love Pac-Man. Do you think I am demanding that Pac-Man looks like a person? 

The people opposite of me, and this is very very important that you understand this:

The people who as you put it, bought an M rated game to fap to, *are the people saying she is supposed to be a realistic looking human.*

You want to be taken seriously, you say you are asking with seriousness,

and yet you got what the sides were actually saying completely flipped around?

No sir. You are believing what you want  to believe. Right now. I am telling you the fappers are the ones arguing this, and yet you say it is the other side? You are not listening. You are drawing your own conclusions based on preconceived beliefs.

So, once again. What is happening here:

Me: That's not what human woman looks like, hehe that's a lot of jiggle physics, but I really don't care if people want to play as a freaking boob/human chimera. Different strokes for different folks. I have played hentai games before. That's more than 1.

French IGN Article: This is not what women look like.

Them: No she's totally looks like a real person, since they body scanned a real person.

Me: Filling with anger at this stupid argument.
38 433 0.9838400483131409 >The people who as you put it, bought an M rated game to fap to, *are the people saying she is supposed to be a realistic looking human.*

Yeah... That's what I said; They're saying that in opposition to those who are panning the game for a lack of realism.

>You want to be taken seriously, you say you are asking with seriousness,

Never said anything close to this.

>and yet you got what the sides were actually saying completely flipped around?

Nope. You should probably reread my comment, because it sounds like you're the one who's got things backwards.

>You are drawing your own conclusions based on preconceived beliefs.

lol damn. I hope that after you've reread my comment you can appreciate the irony of this statement

Setting all that aside, you really shouldn't get so worked up over such trivial shit. Not to play the enlightened centerist here, but both sides are being childish by making such a big deal about nothing.
38 434 0.9882494211196899 The thing that enrages me is the continual attack of Stellar Blade that they fall back on that the main character doesn’t look like a “natural woman”.

There’s plenty of real life women that have crazier proportions than Eve. The logical end of the argument you side on requires the dehumanization of women who have surgery to enhance their looks. Whom I should inform you are very real people.

The whole discussion about a fictional characters body image is an effort in futility and only serves to signal your insecurities.
38 434 0.9894408583641052 > There’s plenty of real life women that have crazier proportions than Eve

If you think this is what human beings look like... I have no words.

Also her bust and butt gets bigger and smaller depending on her outfit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1ckk52d/eve_has_7_or_8_body_types_here_they_are_in/

Eve has 7 or 8 body types.

Just like real people? Antifact?

and you are going to respond with how different clothing and stuff like spanks increases or decreases a woman's proportions, and then I am going to point and laugh at you, because that is not what is going on. Her literal character model's proportions change, and if you looked, and were honest, you would admit that. You won't admit that, but we both know that is what is happening.

Watch as her proportions literally shift: (NSFW) https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F2mwhbk54pjyc1.gif (NSFW)

If I'm playing a game where the outfits are really revealing or the character is oversexualized for no good reason then I hate it.


It's like those Skyrim mods where everyone and everything has gigantic boobs lol. No judgment if anyone likes that stuff, but personally I don't ALWAYS want to see horny things constantly and I have trouble playing games with too much of that. It feels cringy or embarrassing to me.

No dig at you, but the people who are mad at the show. I blame a lack of reading comprehension, unless these themes are directly spoken into the camera for a narrative show they didn’t pick up on them. I guess reading in game dialogue and lore materials was above their head.

Yeah they often fall for this kind of thing. They don't seem to understand that the internet covers almost the entire planet, so of course there will be patterns if you go looking for proof after you've made up your mind that something is true.

74 561 0.9974262118339539 > The cuts were a good thing.

Sure, if you're wealthy and you still blindly believe trickle down economics work (it doesn't):

-The cuts were skewed  to the rich. Households with incomes in the top 1 percent will receive an average tax cut of more than $60,000 in 2025, compared to an average tax cut of less than $500 for households in the bottom 60 percent. Eroded the U.S. revenue base and exploded the deficit.

-Eroded the U.S. revenue base to the point Americans are in real danger of losing Social Security and health coverage

Failed to deliver promised economic benefits. Like the Bush tax cuts before it, the 2017 Trump tax cut was a trickle-down failure.

If you care to educate yourself [here you go](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/the-2017-trump-tax-law-was-skewed-to-the-rich-expensive-and-failed-to-deliver). If you're already wealthy, well, bully for you.

Any tax bill has cuts skewed to the rich, because they pay the majority of taxes. Do you think the Inflation Reduction Act was a bad bill because those cuts were skewed to the rich too?

>to the point Americans are in real danger of losing social security

> So there is more to their stance than a wistful yearning for acceptance in a world they never made. Their real motivation is an instinctive certainty as to what the score really is. They are out of the ballgame and they know it. Unlike the campus rebels, who with a minimum amount of effort will emerge from their struggle with a validated ticket to status, the outlaw motorcyclist views the future with the baleful eye of a man with no upward mobility at all. In a world increasingly geared to specialists, technicians and fantastically complicated machinery, the Hell's Angels are obvious losers and it bugs them. But instead of submitting quietly to their collective fate, they have made it the basis of a full-time social vendetta. They don't expect to win anything, but on the other hand, they have nothing to lose.

I don’t think you know how protests “tend to work better” at all. Because if historically famous protests *didn’t* upset people or “chase” them off the cause, they *probably* wouldn’t be historically famous protests. 

Everyone remember how *wildly* popular the Civil Rights Act *and* desegregation was in the 60s? Amazing to think that MLK was able to team up with Barry Goldwater to win over the *entire* South with some great barbecues.

87 219 0.9749232530593872 What blows my mind is getting notes is, like, super common. Name a show, I guarantee you it had notes. [Carroll O'Connor, the dude who played Archie Bunker on All in the Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker), would regularly call scripts a good start before giving his suggestions on how to improve it. He and Norman Lear would regularly bump heads. Sure, Lear created Archie Bunker, but he acted Archie, he got into the characters head and made it his own. In a way, he was Archie Bunker and could look at a situation through the character's perspective. Whereas Lear was more just the father, looking on from afar.

 And that was back in the 1970s. I think Seinfeld was just really lucky with his show because it seemed like he was pretty free to do whatever. But a lot of sitcoms are not like that. Matt Groening would regularly trash Fox because they kept insisting on changes to Futurama. The original deal for the Simpsons was that the writers kind of had free reign but that deal did not apply to Futurama, so he felt frustrated by Fox Management. And it's not because Fox was wimpy liberals who were afraid of hurting feelings. It's because they, like most management, were only interesting and making the most money. That's it.
87 205 0.9997465014457703 I don't even get that conspiracy. If you want people to be trans, then why not just be open about how everyone in Hollywood is trans? "Want to be rich and famous? Be trans.". If anything, being sneaky about it is the worst way to go about it.

87 93 0.9979479908943176 I would argue that, by their logic, we don't really have a whole lot of real public areas. Most businesses don't allow you to loiter. So, the only thing truly public would be parks and ~~rec~~ libraries.

Between the trolls either arguing with themselves to create fake controversy or agreeing to make it seem like their views are more popular, alts have been popular for a while among internet trolls.

101 701 0.999292254447937 I find it hard to believe that anyone in this day and age is genuinely unaware of what burning fossil fuels does to the atmosphere, or how it contributes to man-made global warming.

In fact I'm having trouble understanding which audience JSO are trying to appeal to with their actions. The people who think global warming is fake or exaggerated or not man-made aren't going to be moved. The people who agree that global warming is a problem don't need any further convincing. The government isn't going to care about people throwing soup at expensive artworks or chucking coloured dust around televised snooker games. It doesn't hurt the bottom line of the fossil fuels industry either.

I also think that the general media is starting to get bored of such stunts from  the likes of JSO and others. It's not news any more. So even the "just getting attention" motivation is starting to lose its effectiveness.
101 403 0.998252809047699 I think the basic idea was to spur others to take action, not just agree that climate change is bad. Now whether that's a good way to go about it is an entirely different question.
101 708 0.9992407560348511 > I find it hard to believe that anyone in this day and age is genuinely unaware of what burning fossil fuels does to the atmosphere, or how it contributes to man-made global warming.

Buuuut it's still happening. You get that's worse, right?

I don't think they're being "effective" but I also don't really give a shit if they toss dye on the glass case of a painting that's going to get ground underneath tank treads in some water-rights war 70 years from now.
101 708 0.9997135996818542 Worse than what? I wasn't making any comparisons.

If they're not being effective then their actions are, at best, pointless. At the worst their actions may indeed help precipitate the apocalyptic events you're fantasising about.

I don't subscribe to the conspiracy theories about groups like JSO being plants by the fossil fuels industry, but I also don't think that such conspiracies are necessary in order for people to be actively counterproductive in spite of their good intentions.
101 700 0.99709153175354 OK, let's grant for the sake of argument that most ordinary people are actively voting in favour of fossil fuel lobbying, instead of having to navigate contemporary democracy's imperfections and picking the least worst options available to them, since climate change is not the only issue at play when voting for a candidate.

Are such people really going to be moved by the kind of stunts JSO pulls off? That seems unlikely. Why would someone willing to vote for fossil fuel lobbyists care if some randoms get held up in traffic? And if they do care, are they likely to say "You know what, these guys have a point"? Or are they more likely to say something like, "the cops should clear off these unwashed hippies"?

Also, if both major parties in a first-past-the-post system can be considered unreliable on the issue of climate change, [as is the case in the UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/politics/labour-green-investment-starmer-reeves-b2492551.html), then voters really don't have any meaningful choices to make on that particular issue. I live in a Labour stronghold constituency, so my voting for the Green Party (or for that matter, any other party) would make no difference to climate change.
101 700 0.9982842803001404 > OK, let's grant for the sake of argument that most ordinary people are actively voting in favour of fossil fuel lobbying, instead of having to navigate contemporary democracy's imperfections and picking the least worst options available to them, since climate change is not the only issue at play when voting for a candidate.

How many of them have told their MP that they care about climate change? It takes all of five minutes to type an email, but how many people do you think have ever done that in their lives? How many of them have ever been to a climate protest? A tiny minority. And why is that? 

> Why would someone willing to vote for fossil fuel lobbyists care if some randoms get held up in traffic?

What do you think would convince them? A century plus of academic research, TV interviews, radio shows, podcasts, high-quality educational video content, TV shows, newspaper articles and op-eds, books for all audiences from children to adults, events and conferences, advocates going to schools to talk about it,  peaceful protests, protesting in front of government buildings, and disrupting the companies who pollute the most? 

They have been doing this for decades. What they are doing now is actually very similar to most other civil rights movements, which were also basically all disruptive and faced a lot of resistance in the beginning.

Probably because writing to MPs is absolutely pointless, that shit just gets fielded by secretaries. MPs get letters all the time. Most people have jobs and responsibilities and thus don't have the time to spare nor the kind of personal situation that allows for going to protests and dealing with the possibility of arrests and all that ancillary stuff.

Yeah, and if someone is unmoved by all of that, then they're not going to be bothered by some strangers getting stuck in traffic. That happens even without protests going on.

> They have been doing all this for decades. What they are doing now is actually very similar to most other civil rights movements, which were also basically all disruptive and faced a lot of resistance at the beginning.

I don't think trying to rhetorically piggy-back on the successes of past movements over different issues is a goer, either. It just comes across as a desperate attempt at faking it. This is coming from someone who considers themselves sympathetic to the goals of groups like JSO, even if their methods leave me scratching my head. 

> A lot of countries (if not most) don't have such a voting system.

Good for them, but FPTP isn't the only means by which modern democracies can fail to accurately represent the interests of their constituents. Things such as regulatory capture and media in the pocket of industries can also happen in proportional systems.
101 700 0.996803879737854 > Probably because writing to MPs is absolutely pointless, that shit just gets fielded by secretaries. MPs get letters all the time.

Okay: they don't do anything themselves to tackle climate change, they don't vote for climate action, they don't even bother to send a letter. Then what exactly would they do? Seems like they want climate action but everything has to stay exactly the same way it has always been. 

> Yeah, and if someone is unmoved by all of that, then they're not going to be bothered by some strangers getting stuck in traffic.

I think so too. The protests at least make it clear who is actually for or against climate action, because nobody would seriously throw out their entire belief system because they heard on the news that some people were stuck in traffic for 30 minutes because of a climate protest.

> I don't think trying to rhetorically piggy-back on the successes of past movements over different issues is a goer, either. It just comes across as a desperate attempt at faking it.

It just goes to show that basically all the protests have been disruptive and have initially faced a lot of resistance. Why would you expect this one to be any different? I bet a lot of people who feel "offended" by climate protests today would claim to have supported the civil rights and other important social movements, but I am almost certain that they would have opposed them for exactly the same reasons that they oppose climate protests today.

> Good for them, but FPTP isn't the only means by which modern democracies can fail to accurately represent the interests of their constituents. Things such as regulatory capture and media in the pocket of industries can also happen in proportional systems.

I mean you basically argued that nothing can be done. I guess the UK is a lost cause at this point because nothing is going to change people's minds in time.

I suppose one could resign oneself to the belief that most people are nothing more than bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling, although in that case I wonder what possible motivation would exist for activism, apart from the warm glow offered by the prospect of being a doomed moral victor.

Personally what I would like to see instead is a recognition from the likes of JSO that maybe perhaps not all of their actions are as well thought-out as they like to think, or that the consequences of such actions won't necessarily turn out as they imagine. Plus a willingness to re-examine their tactics instead of reflexively lashing out at anyone who dares to criticise them.

> I think so too. The protests at least make it clear who is actually for or against climate action, because nobody would seriously throw out their entire belief system because they heard on the news that some people were stuck in traffic for 30 minutes because of a climate protest.

Or maybe some people think that blocking traffic for 30 minutes doesn't count as a meaningful mode of climate action?

> It just goes to show that basically all the protests have been disruptive and have initially faced a lot of resistance. Why would you expect this one to be any different?

Ah, so you *are* going with the "most people are just bastards" thesis. I think you're doing a whole more to argue against climate action than I ever could.

> I mean you basically argued that nothing can be done. I guess the UK is a lost cause at this point because nothing is going to change people's minds in time.

No, I did not make such an argument. I called out specific actions as being unlikely, in my estimation, to lead to significant results. I also pointed out how democracies aren't perfect representations of the interests of constituents. That is not the same thing as saying nothing can be done.

As for "in time", climate change is already happening. There is no "day of judgement" approaching in which we will all be judged for our environmental sins. That kind of apocalyptic, millenarian rhetoric is a poor fit for the circumstances.

They allow someone with gaps in their knowledge of the world to quickly and easily fill those gaps with something that they can process and distill into black and white.

The reality is that the world is full of billions of people which makes for an unbelievably complex society. You can either become comfortable with the fact that it's impossible to understand even a little of it very well, let alone all of it, or you can fall back on childishly simple conspiracy theories and magical thinking.

And I mean, it makes sense, right? We were told our whole lives that we were special just for being who we are. So, of course, we're going to have the sort of insightful mind that "NPCs" won't be able to comprehend. And why should we have to do all the work it would take to really fully understand something like a pandemic response? We're special! So now we have this conspiracy theory that we learned in like, 2 hours, that we're using as gospel and in lieu of centuries of scientific advances. And we get to be really smug when we tell the "normies" that what the MSM is telling them is just what the Deep State *wants* you to think, but we have the real inside knowledge thanks to this facebook video we watched on the shitter.

130 209 0.9529913067817688 Plus, *all* ways of having children, without giving birth to them yourself, are harder than that usual way. There's *no* easy path to parenthood for a couple who're unable to make a baby in the usual way.

If you pass all of the tests you then face, some of which are unfairly *financial* (even compared with how much children normally cost), then you're clearly much more determined to have a child than most people, and I think that probably means you'll be better parents. Especially compared with all of the people who end up having kids essentially *by accident*, or just because they believe this is a thing that normal people are required to do, with an assumption that having a baby means that you'll love it, and be fine with the immense task that you have just given yourself.

(I can't help thinking that there should be some hoops that people should have to jump through before they can have an "ordinary" biological baby. But I also **know** that even with the very best of intentions, any attempt to prevent people from having children until they're "qualified" to do so is almost certain to slide directly down into [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), which is always worse than the thing that it's trying to prevent. If genetic testing shows that there's a 90% chance that a child of yours will have some awful medical condition then obviously you shouldn't have one, but *legislating* things like this never, ever, stops there.)

But it is very funny. There are minuscule protections against firing someone in this country, and transphobic is not a protected class, nor is republican or any other form of bigoted. Firing her over this would be both legally fine and expected. But she wasn't even *fired.* She just wasn't renewed. The free market is great until an alt-right bigot loses a job, then it's gone too far and time for the government to intervene.

They had two different churches they went to.  The Polish Catholics lived a few streets away and had their own church.  None of them were considered white until the schools got integrated in the 70s.  Then they were all white.

185 219 0.9996875524520874 Expensive scripted programs no longer produced in overabundance for a slowly dying medium? I blame *the left*. [Only sane comment in the thread gets it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1cfkjar/comment/l1ppmge/), naturally downvoted into oblivion. 

My absolute favorite part of this clip:

>Jerry Seinfeld: <some ranting about getting notes on your script, I guess>

>Interviewer: Have you had that experience?

>JS: Uhm. No.

What is he even talking about then? Is he complaining about something he hasn't experienced at all? What an ass.

Meanwhile, in the real world, where things actually happen, I'm assured that getting notes on a script is an entirely normal and accepted (if often annoying) part of the process. I have to assume it always has been. Certainly, it was a thing before 2016 ["broke Hollywood"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1cfkjar/comment/l1q0fu5/)

I also enjoyed the part about how standup is the better medium anyway, because audiences react, and he can adjust "instantly." Yet he won't play college campuses anymore because those audiences are too woke or sensitive or some shit.

I'm starting to think maybe it's Jerry Seinfeld who is the problem here...
185 220 0.9997735619544983 lack of comedy on tv? What world is he living in?
185 221 0.999187171459198 I worked in an agency that used Seinfeld for a campaign. He was a prick. Rude to everyone, refused to do the script (after signing off on it) and killed the whole premise of the campaign. Still collected 10 million.
185 222 0.9975772500038147 He's mad at society because people aren't cool with men in their very late 30's dating 17 year olds. 

Side note, I just finished the series "Ted." His assessment is way off. You don't have to be "PC," you just have to be funny, which Jerry is not. Larry David is funny, but I guess his humor is just "grandfathered" in lol. 

"Larry is grandfathered in, so people still find him funny. So you see, it's not that I'm unfunny. It's that the extreme left has brainwashed society into thinking I'm not funny while letting others slide sometimes!"
185 223 0.998925507068634 People can make jokes. Comedians can make any joke about any topic if it’s funny.

Comedians who bomb and jokes don’t hit are now telling us they can’t that they can’t tell jokes because “woke liberals” won’t allow them to jokes.

That’s bullshit. You’re just not funny. If your jokes aren’t funny, it’s on you. Craft better jokes. The audience isn’t the problem. The problem is no one finds you funny.

Seinfeld is still telling jokes from the late 1990s and is upset modern audiences don’t find his 1990s observational humor funny. That’s not a problem with an audience. That’s a problem with Seinfeld not telling new jokes for a new audience.

“We can’t tell jokes” is a fucking cop out by people who aren’t funny.

You’re just not funny, dumbass. The audience doesn’t find you funny. Don’t blame the audience because you aren’t funny, idiot.
185 224 0.9976221919059753 I think this is more of a generational thing. JS is 70 and his style of comedy now belongs to the dinosaurs. The "airplane food" school of comedy has been dead for a while. That doesn't mean that the audience for it has died, just that its audience of 70yr olds is smaller and smaller because they're, well, dying. It's the same thing with music. 

Rock killed the Big Bands. No self-respecting teenager wanted to listen to their parents music in the 50's. They wanted something "good." Some artists, like Louis Prima, tried to accommodate the new style but they were old and sounded old. Most of them kept playing what they knew and protested that Rock wasn't music and should be mocked and censored before they destroyed society. 

Fortunately, there's always Vegas for the dying. And Branson, MO.
185 225 0.9618125557899475 Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Chapelle, and Bill Maher are some of the more vocal comedians about "cancel culture" and "woke" stuff. They're also about 15 years past the peak of their standup careers. They can't accept good crowds, they need *great* crowds.

All the complaining about the politically correct left is just marketing on their part.

185 228 0.0030879974365234375 I’m a bit of a comedy nerd. I find the structure of standup and comedy shows deeply fascinating. And the idea that you can’t be funny while not punching down is ridiculous. And don’t mistake it, that’s what he’s talking about. Watch 30 rock, Seinfeld, just about anything 10-15 years old and there is a ton of punching down, making fun of people for things not their fault. 

Seinfeld absolutely revolutionized the sitcom, but even the finale was basically them on trial for laughing at someone going through something traumatic. Maybe Jerry was a little prescient because yes right now most of us would think that was tasteless and unfunny. 

The idea that you can’t be funny without punching down is pure laziness. Arrested Development managed it (mostly), Good Place managed it, it’s doable. The real issue is people are demanding a higher, better level of comedy that people like Jerry can’t deliver.
185 229 0.8470282554626465 He said this years ago, I think everyone thought that would be the last we'd hear from him for a while, do your car show - you have the illusion of being a nice guy for a bit, it was nice to see a glimmer of what made us like you.  

But no.... I guess he's desperate to cash in on election season.  Hey Jerry, guess who made a very successful, very recent comedy show that thrived in this "hostile" environment?  Sure he punched a Muppet, but he's handling things pretty well.  Maybe go talk to that guy, he might have some tips on longevity in the biz.  

Maybe go punch Grover?

185 232 0.9995883107185364 So what's Seinfeld's problem?  Sounds like a hack who couldn't change with the times and is blaming the culture shifting for his being unable to keep up...Same shit as dopes like Bill Maher. No, its not wokeness that's the problem, dude. You made a career off of shitting on easy targets, and now that the culture has changed and we no longer find it cool or socially acceptable to dunk on Muslims and gay people, you are upset because your material from 3 decades ago doesn't fly in 2024.  That's YOUR problem.  If you could only make a career out of picking on the marginalized, that shows what a fucking lousy comedian you are.

George Carlin's bits about Monopoly, Little Things we Share, Modern Man, or Airline Announcements. Nothing controversial, political, not woke, not PC, not anything. Yet still hilarious today.  

Here's an idea, Jerry. Get with the times. You got complacent and comfortable and are bitching about it because you got left behind while everyone else evolved.  We don't need to accommodate you so you can feel like you've got a career again by pretending like your shit isn't dated and stuck in 1992.  You need to update. And if you can't, it shows how lacking your skills are.

185 233 0.9929627776145935 For anyone unfamiliar with Seinfeld and why he suddenly is getting his name in the news again, its because he has a new show about poptarts coming out and needs the publicity.

185 246 0.9959617257118225 It's painfully obvious everyone in this comment section has never seen Jerry do standup past the 90s. He never did an airline food joke IRL either, that was Kramer.
185 247 0.9996324777603149 Ah, poor Jerry, can’t figure out the difference between punching up and punching down.
185 248 0.9992682337760925 Why are the people who are not extreme-left, but simply conventionally left-leaning upset about this?
185 249 0.9967429041862488 This may be super unpopular here, but if you listen to the clip, Jerry isn’t off base here.  Not really.  He is ham fisted in his characterization a bit but basically just saying that comedy on tv and film now gets sterilized by corporate interests who possibly (probably) over police the content for fear of backlash.  

This is usually my perspective when people say you couldn’t make blazing saddles or airplane today.  The audience gets that it’s lampooning bigots or xenophobes, but a production content monitor would not.  Self-financed and distributed you could absolutely make blazing saddles today, attached to a studio you could not.  

The reality is, comedy IS evolving.  We see it in many films and shows that are being produced, it’s just that the metric watching CEOs are gun-shy because they live in a world of predicted outcomes.  What we need are more hit comedies that do provide both sound comedic effect and sensible reflection of society.

Jerry may well be enter his “bill maher curmudgeon” phase but he’s not really speaking gibberish on this.
185 250 0.999704897403717 I actually listened to the entire interview and this is a poor representation fyi
185 251 0.9969526529312134 He's got a platform a lot of comics don't have. And they feel unable to do the comedy they want to (and which a lot of people like) because people take videos, cut them up and post them without context, seriously harming the careers of these comedians in the process. Because he will always sell out shows, has a genuine love for the art form and has fuck you money, he says what others are afraid to say and/or can't be heard saying. And it's not just him saying this type of thing. A lot of successful comedians are saying it. The far left is becoming a very loud minority and it's turning centre left people off because a lot of the shit they're crying about is ridiculous. Stop looking for things to be offended and angry about. You're doing exactly what he says you're doing and acting like it's not happening. There are important issues that need your energy. Trade unionists don't cry about broken toilet seats and cheap toilet paper. Martin Luther King wasnt complaining about white people playing the blues. Grow the fuck up.

Firstly, if you get infuriated by casting decisions by private entities with their own money - go touch grass, breathe in some fresh air and try and remember that you will die in 50-60 years tops and spending time being infuriated by casting choices is you personally failing at life. Like seriously, if you get INFURIATED by a black girl being cast as Juliet in a stage play you will definitely never go an see - revaluate your life choices, for your own sake.

Secondly, a ton of men have played Juliet, and a ton of white people have played Othello historically. Theaters in China, Nigeria and Brazil have all done thousands of adaptations of Shakspeare with local actors in their local languages. People of every gender, race and age have played Hamlet, and will continue to do so. The sheer lunacy of focusing on one adaptation of Romeo and Juliet where she is black, when AS WE SPEAK hundreds of non-Italian women of age , including many black women, are portraying Veronian 16 year old Juliet SOMEWHERE - is just a sign that you people have no fucking idea what you are talking about when you cry and bitch and moan about theater casting decisions.

>I think the double standards is what drives people nuts.

What fucking double standard? People have been playing characters of various ages, sexes and races in plays since before the printing press existed. Something the fat angry virgins at r/conservative would have known if they ever read the first thing about the history of theater.

No, they aren't angry about some non-existant double standards, they are angry because those miserable motherfuckers are just a flock of delusional crybaby racists that are either too braindead to know about real actual problems the world is facing or too privileged to care about them, so they spend their lives crying about black women getting cast in West End plays.

People all over the world are dying in warzones and from hunger, and the privileged Western shitstains are seething with anger over some girl becoming like the 100th black woman to play Juliet, because they'd rather be little crybaby bitches that throw racist temper tantrums over a play happening in a city most of them can't point on a map of London, than be normal about literally anything involving people who have a different skincolor than them.

And as much as I personally love superhero media, if you really think that "but whatabout Black Panther played by a white guy, mmmm?" is a good comeback - firstly, grow up and go read something meant for people who've finished puberty, and secondly, if Black Panther ever becomes a Romeo and Juliet-level cultural touchstone, I assure you there will be at least a couple adaptations where he is white or he is a she or a they (and also we'd probably be living in some dystopian nightmare where Disney is the world government), so please stop using it as an example.

204 211 0.9910513162612915 Here's a question. 

Is Black Panther's story *informed* by his race? Do the stories being told, especially the themes, ground his race as a something that will be explored? 

They do? Inserting. 

Now, let's talk about Romeo and Juliet. Are any themes or character development pieces directly informed by the characters' races?


No? 


Interesting.
204 211 0.9578464031219482 i dont think in such depths. If somebody does a movie..he should be able to do it the way he wants it. You may choose to see it or not.


Why should it bother me that a black man plays King Albert of england? i dont like the ideea ..i dont watch the movie. Its very simple ..why should anybody have a problem with this.


If some director wants chris hemsworth as black panther so be it. If i dont like it i dont watch it. But i want the director to do it..


I woud love to see a comedy with dave chappele playing hitler..it would be hilarious.


Its the double standard that i have a problem with.

206 345 0.9895511269569397 It looks pretty yellow to me. What color do people think it is now....?
206 345 0.9864472150802612 The sun is a blackbody (though not a perfect one).  So the color of the sun is white as it emits all wavelengths of light.  So what happens when people see the sun during sunset or during a cloudy day or in Beijing you don't actually see all of the suns light because it is being filtered out by particulates in the air in addition to being subject to even more scattering than at noon when the sun is directly over head.  

Now don't ever stare at the sun but if you catch a glimpse during the day and then during sunset you will see the difference.  The sun has always been the same color (when compared to human lifespans at least) but the amount of particulates in our atmosphere have changed.

Edit: to answer your question they say it's brighter than it used to be or whiter.

207 700 0.9996979236602783 I don't know if they're objectively harmful or not harmful.  I have no way to judge that.  What I do know is that hearing that a group threw tomato soup on a painting to protest fossil fuels means approximately nothing to me and does not make me interested in supporting them, joining them or learning more about them.  This is not true about people who take direct action against relevant targets, not true about people engaging in street protests or sitdowns, not true about people who are blocking highways, so don't lump me in with people who don't want protests to be noticed.  I want them to be noticed, but I also want them to have a point.  Everything that gets out about this group is just dumb.
207 707 0.9985449314117432 JSO also blocked oil refineries but I bet you've never heard about that. All it did was end in the arrests of the protestors and no media coverage. No surprise they started doing far more controversial and public protests.

Throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting was supposed to elicit an emotional response, which makes a symbolic point about climate change. Do people care more about a painting they've never heard of being destroyed than they do their own planet? The answer being, of fucking course they do, and no, they don't get the irony.

The fact so few people actually understood the point of the protest is an indictment of both the media's honesty, and the average person's intelligence.
209 394 0.7948415279388428 The advantage is mostly monetary. That's why a country that cares about it's children should have great public resources available to parents... to ensure the best chances of good outcomes and not directly restrict who do and do not "qualify" since..

219 252 0.99895179271698 He's just mad because people called him out for being a groomer. That's gotta sting a little. I've noticed that if a celebrity starts bitching about "the left" or "wokeness" out of nowhere, they've probably done some heinous shit and have started to see the absolute bare minimum of consequences. Usually just people acknowledging the bad thing they did.
219 252 0.9967935681343079 The first I heard of him being what we'd now call anti-woke was around 2015, when he decided he wasn't going to play college campuses anymore. The whole meeting a 17 year old in the park when he was in his late 30s and dating her for years thing happened in the early 90s, and was controversial at the time (as it obviously should have been). So I'm not sure it's the cause of his current behavior -- it would either have been a really slow burn, or there's more of this stuff that I'm just unaware of. I can totally believe it contributed though.

I think this sort of thing is mostly caused by people losing touch with the world they knew and thought they had a handle on, and then lashing out at what they perceive to be the cause of that change (often some sort of social progress). But if you've been criticized by people you perceive also to be agents of that unwelcome change, that probably reinforces your views.

Jerry Seinfeld was a huge star, and his show was essential viewing. These days he's more of an afterthought, and the medium that made him a household name isn't doing so well, either. I'm sure that's a difficult adjustment, and I bet it's easier to blame the audience than reflect on how he could change to fit changing times.
219 253 0.976173460483551 Amazing that they're so invested in the decline of comedy and hollywood, but also so invested in seeing it destroyed. I don't cry about things I don't care about. why do they?
219 254 0.9992485642433167 >i'm starting to think maybe it's Jerry Seinfeld who is the problem here...

I heard that in the voice of Newman. And Larry David and Julia L-D are still working pretty consistently in comedy so maybe it is.

And maybe we lost the appetite for plotlines where men in their late thirties date high schoolers for lol.
219 255 0.9242647290229797 "Notes" have always been a thing. The people with the money (producers and studios) want to make sure their investment is going to make them more money than they spent on it. As they control the purse strings, they have input on the final product. If an artist wants to put their own resources into a project they can do so and create whatever they like, but when they play with other people's money they have to listen.

219 293 0.9912096261978149 Conservative humor just surmounts to bitching about how everyone gets offended by everything.  It involves a lot of mocking of people being offended and/or cockatoo imitations and it is largely just performative.  There's no clever points being made or even particularly original points.

But one thing is guaranteed, which is that conservative boomers eat it up.  They'll give you money just to say you don't like "wokeness".  Pretend it's a comedy show?  They'll pay even more.  Ultimately they just like to hear people in agreement with their hateful and bigoted opinions.

It's easier for them to switch to conservative humor than it is to always come up with new jokes.  I'm just sorry to see Jerry Seinfeld to have stooped to that level.  He was a bright star in comedy, and now he'll be doing comedy tours with Roseanne Barr and Jim Breuer for the rest of his life.

Certain things have become less popular, such as making fun of racial sterotypes, but that's not because people are afraid to. Its because most people no longer find it funny. 20 years ago I thought Dave Chappelle making jokes about how black people are all like this and white people are all like that was hilarious. Now the concept is just so stupid its not even humorous to joke about anymore. People aren't as ignorant about  that because the world continues to get smaller.

Entertainment has cycles.  

Plus reality TV is cheap.  

What he seemed to be whining about was , stand ups don't get sitcoms anymore ( eg The Cosby show, everybody loves Ray, King of Queens, roseanne , news radio.  there were several others based on stand up comics) because  actors will just act in drama, horror, mystery , medical or cops shoes ECT.  There are comics on TV theyre doing things other than sitcoms.  

Oh the weirdest part  all of those shows he mentioned, I'm pretty sure none of the stars were "comics".  Carroll O'Connor, Mary Tyler Moore, Alan alda those people were all actors.  He didn't mention Carol Burnett show, for example. 


Me personally , I think it's time to bring back more Sketch comedy. The kids in the hall, in living color , mad TV the aforementioned Carol Burnett show style.  In the 10pm time slot.

232 395 0.33867162466049194 See, I think it's a solid phrase.  The irony was that it was constantly trotted out by the most feelings driven people in existence to project their delusions onto those of us living in reality. It was also meant to gaslight people into thinking they were wrong about something when, again, it was the feelings people who were confidently incorrect about everything.


Which is why I love flinging it back at them and watching them bluster and complete more mental gymnastics as they seethe that their own beloved mantra is being aimed at the people it always needed to be for a change.


Remember, facts don't care about YOUR feelings. *Their* feelings, on the other hand, are precious.

249 273 0.9965147376060486 This is just a ridiculous assertion though because all you need to do is watch say an episode of Friends side by side with an episode of Big Bang Theory and its just about the same.

I think if you had a movie like Blazing Saddles you could get that made today.  The problem is that Blazing saddles is a great movie and its really hard to make great movies.

And Airplane is a terrible example because they are literally in the process of making a new Naked Gun movie.  It probably won't be that funny but it won't be because a big studio won't allow it to be funny, its just hard to do movies that well.

You saw that with the Pink Panther movies that got made.  Pink Panther wasn't really that edgy of a comedy so I think its a good place to look at because the new one (I think there were two) were terrible.  

And then the good comedies especially on TV aren't getting viewers.  30 Rock was kind of a nothing burger ratings wise compared to something like The Big Bang Theory.  Parks and Recs took a bit to find its footing but it found it and was on the verge of being canceled a few times because it was never that popular.

The only comedies on TV that I think were massively successful that critics and audiences liked were The Office and Modern Family (and Modern Family definitely declined somewhat quickly but it was really well done early on).

Make a film set a century ago and you can showcase the inherent racism of the era in the film. You'll likely get more complaints if you whitewashed the racism away entirely.

There are multiple comments from others who also listened to the whole interview and they agree with me

“Why can’t you make a point or argument?”

… uhh my point is that if you actually listen to the interview you would see the characterization in this post is a poor representation

The idea that, because I actually listened to the interview and don’t agree with OP’s misrepresentation, somehow makes me anti-left just shows how ignorant you truly are. I’ve always voted for a democratic president smh. You are spewing tribalistic brain rot

258 267 0.6790192127227783 The people complaining are in one of 2 camps that I've noticed. Those who are being called out for creepy shit in their life (like grooming a teenager) or they're mad that they're not allowed to bully the groups the used.

Jimmy Carr has done the same style for 2 decades. The trick is, that you don't make your audience the asshole for laughing. Jimmy is the asshole and he plays into it. 

Shane Gillis has a whole bit about down syndrome. Gillis is the butt of the joke, not people with downs. Even Louis C.K. had a bit where he uses the N-word, but the bit was how much of an ass and moron he is.
258 300 0.9997478127479553 The third camp is comedians who just aren't funny any more. I tried to watch Gervais' and Chapelle's last shows and they just weren't funny. Listening to a rich guy complain about how oppressed they are isn't funny.

262 284 0.998480498790741 A while ago there was a clip of Jerry Seinfeld being rude to Kesha after she got excited to see him and asked for a hug during a filmed charity event. He said "No thanks" and told someone else he didn't know who she was. It's 100% understandable that he wouldn't want a hug, but his attitude was so cold that Kesha called it the most depressing moment in her life. This was after she managed to leave her former abusive manager/producer and restart her career as a more authentic artist.

Reddit had a field day bashing Kesha for the Seinfeld incident, and he's 100% not required to indulge fans with hugs, but it is his choice to be an asshole about it and humiliate other people when he's appearing at a filmed event where he's expected to be a comedic performer.
262 284 0.9974103569984436 I'm familiar with that one. I'll add the Larry King interview when Larry asked him if Seinfeld was cancelled or if he ended the show. I mean, yeah, it's kind of a "come on, man" type of question, but one that would be very easy to give a funny response to but his response was ridiculously insecure and kinda demeaning to Larry. I've seen some clips from interviews about Bee Movie that give similar vibes, and it all tracks with things I've heard about him from people I know who have crossed paths with him in professional settings as well. He's funny and a great writer, but way too full of himself for someone who absolutely doesn't need to be. It goes completely against the incredible persona he developed for the Seinfeld character.
264 302 0.9970048069953918 Fuck me we actually DID make Blazing Saddles again, in the form of Tropic Thunder.

Is blackface offensive? Yes. And Robert Downey Jr. is in it *the entire movie.* So why don't we call it racist and bad? Because it being so unbelievably racist was the *point* and it's *repeatedly commented on as being what the fuck.*

Plus, like, Blazing Saddles' use of the n-word everywhere is... fine? It'd be one thing if the hero heroically slurs the black man, but the ones slinging it are simple folks. People of the land. You know, *morons.* I don't think anyone walked away from that movie thinking Mel Brooks was a racist.
264 303 0.010803043842315674 The second paragraph raises an interesting question, though: what genre is the modern equivalent to westerns in ubiquity that could be satirized blazing saddles-style? Superhero movies have been in a bit of a decline recently, but they're probably still one of the most ubiquitous genres.
264 303 0.8778038024902344 I'm not actually sure, I'm not sure there is one.  There were decades of ; books, radio shows, TV , movies, live shows.  Shows for kids, grown ups and family shows. Love stories, tragedies, comedies, action, musicals, Saturday afternoon serials, "true stories" , mythology/ folk tales, some westerns were stylized as samurai movies, anti-hero.  There were only 3 networks  everyone saw the same things. And westerns romanticize and/or whitewashed a lot of history, which made it more poignant.    Sort of like pirates of the Caribbean, except rather than a few movies and a couple private themed shows it was everywhere.  

As for superhero they're not comedies but the boys is sort of filling the same social commentary role that blazing saddles did.
265 286 0.9980332255363464 I mean, I agree with the sentiment but that’s not a great example considering 5 episodes aren’t available for streaming due to their content.
269 300 0.9990177154541016 This. The last 4 specials Chapelle did have like 2 jokes combined. And the jokes weren’t good enough that I laughed. Just structured like a joke, so I noticed them, since nothing else he said in them were even meant to be jokes. It was like 50% complaining, 20% stories about meeting OJ Simpson that had no punchlines, and 30% being openly jealous of Kevin Hart.

275 432 0.9979941844940186 I'm the same way.   I'm not a prude, but as an example, I found the overt sexualization of Bayonetta to be such a turn off I stopped playing the game entirely.   

  
(And don't get me started about how that's OK because Bayonetta was created by a woman.  Like women can't objectify women.)
275 297 0.04098707437515259 I was listening to a podcast talking about that and they made a great point. It was about how these things supposedly have the name of kids if you looked it up or were sometimes even tagged with "child" and the person was saying why would they do that? When you're trying to secretly sell something, you don't put the name of the secret thing in the listing! That would be like selling drugs online with "I'm selling something secret, but it's cocaine, I'm selling cocaine".
277 296 0.5327208638191223 Was Seinfeld ever even the least bit edgy in his standups? I'd always assumed from what I saw included on the show that it was absolutely inoffensive.
277 296 0.004484713077545166 Nope. I actually think that’s one of the reasons his standup got successful at the time, because it was broadly accessible and relatable, and almost “old-school” in a way, just safe topics about day to day stuff, and it didn’t rely on gimmicks like being offensive or edgy.
277 483 0.9983106851577759 The simplistic “logic” employed by these people ignores the fact that adoption can take a long time and can take a lot of effort, and often results in the denial of an adoption request. It’s not an easy process. I know many gay couples who *want* to adopt, and are trying to adopt, but it’s a long and uphill process. They’ve been at it for years and none of them have been approved yet.

280 298 0.9560888409614563 Which is silly, because that type of comedy still exists and is widely available. 

You can still joke about anything and everything. The comedians that play up the cancel culture narrative are doing so because they're not able to craft funny bits. If anything, the list of subjects you can do in your act is vastly larger than it was 50 years ago.

281 428 0.10166186094284058 Yeah if the game was somehow full of hundreds of black samurai then like, I guess you could say it's blackwashing Japanese culture. But this guy is pretty well documented and makes for an interesting character for assassin's creed. I mean, he's so out of place it almost sounds like he is a super assassin time traveler dude.
281 429 0.9510034322738647 That's the guy you play as. He's an outsider who ended up working for the most powerful man in Japan with very little else being known about him.

283 395 0.0017597675323486328 The people in the comments pretending the chairs **don't** look like penises are full of it.

The chairs **clearly** look like a penis. (And they are hilarious because of it.) Acknowledging that sometimes things kinda look like genitalia (shout-out to r/mildlyvagina) doesn't make you some sort of deviant pervert.
283 612 0.9927616715431213 Yeah sometimes people counterjerk too hard and end up saying ridiculous stuff just to have the opposite opinion of people they dislike.

295 480 0.9974197149276733 Agreed.... I've seen school board meetings where school board members talk down to the parents.  

Here's an example...trying to level the playing field, they weaken the meritocracy and accuse black parents of being tokenized:  
[https://mynorthwest.com/3956197/rantz-seattle-gifted-program-public-schools-racism/](https://mynorthwest.com/3956197/rantz-seattle-gifted-program-public-schools-racism/)

I'm a parent, and I am a registered independent, and I'm not sure where I sit on the public school issue yet.  I will tell you what doesn't help the left....when anything conservative comes up with public schools, left leaning peoples have a reflex to demonize any of the conservative idea or persons or points.  

I have grave concerns on how American public schools (K-12) seem to be falling behind with STEM metrics.  Does that make me a top mind?  Am I a conspiracy theorist now?
295 480 0.9292261004447937 There's a difference between legitimate concerns and a lot of wild shit out there. The ones I saw were all about actual conspiracy theories related to Covid.
295 480 0.9799537658691406 That's the red vs blue game.  Each side highlights and demonizes the craziest elements of the competitor.  Eventually, for anyone that only consumes one side of the argument, or only consumes one side of the media spin, they eventually gain a hatred and distrust against the other side, fully, full stop.

I see communism and meritocracies being mutually exclusive.  In a capitalist democracy, we need a fair meritocracy with equal opportunity to thrive.  I will die on that hill, and I will fight against unfair oppression, racism, nepotism AS WELL AS anyone that wants to water-down the meritocracy system because they want equal outputs (with disregard to the inputs).
295 480 0.978078305721283 I hate to burst your bubble, but capitalism isn't a meritocracy either.
295 480 0.41572052240371704 Unfettered capitalism isn't, but governed capitalism is probably the closest humans have come.  Would you propose a different system that has done it better?

297 477 0.06257116794586182 It's because in their minds "being accountable to the public" means "personally accountable to however I see fit".

But these TopMinds are convinced that everyone is secretly trans and then they build a conspiracy around this idea. The things about satanism and whatnot are because obviously they need to invent a clandestine and evil reason for why everyone is secretly trans.

304 449 0.0005677342414855957 I think it is fascinating to see how the trends in tinfoilhat circles evolve.
304 449 0.9843340516090393 In a sociological sense, sure, but I agree with Prometheus too. If the bad actors can mesh conspiracy with religion it can get a whole lot worse. Suddenly you get the American Christian demographic believing it. A huge voting bloc that swings elections while having completely lost touch with reality. The world’s toughest military, most important economy, and huge cultural powerhouse. Run by people who believe in witches and want to bring back burning them.

Bad for America and by extension everyone else in the world. Somehow magat candidates have won elections in places that aren’t America.
304 449 0.9915145635604858 Obviously it is a bad thing that these people are getting more unhinged. Bad for their mental health. Bad for their families who see their loved ones go off the deep end. Bad for innocent people if some of them decide to shoot it out with the "daemons" or whatever they are afraid of.


But I dispute the claim that this is less interesting than the "generic" conspiracy theories. Because to me seeing the shifts as the conspiracy "bubble" goes from one style of insanity to another, is interesting.


Over the last few decades, I have seen a bunch of separate conspiracies be melded into one ...I won't quite call it a "grand unified theory" but there has been melding and attempts to get everyone to agree to at least broadly fuse conspiracies. ...Usually by making everyone accuse the Jews of being involved somehow, but with a few codewords for them. But now, this daemonic thing or satanism thing is the new craze that is taking over the tinfoil world. Many of them are obsessed with the "magic" of having the evil conspiracy leave intentional clues for people to see. It used to be that when the Top Minds claim they discovered the conspiracy, it was because THEY were smarter than anyone else and cracked the code. Now it's not even that. Now they claim that the clues are part of magic ritual where the villains can't do their world domination without leaving the clues, because it is part of the magic.


Which is a fascinating change because before this, Top Minds were bragging about being smarter than the "sheep" or even the evil conspiracy. But now they are not the Sherlock Holmes solving the crime, but just a regular Joe who is being taunted by the villain who intentionally makes mistakes.
304 449 0.012857198715209961 You definitely aren’t wrong. I haven’t thought of it in terms of a villain quite like that.

From what I've read its all satan magic/worship. Like Satan has some representation with both male and female characteristics. Therefore trans people are trying to emulate Satan. And the whole "against the natural order" appeal to nature crap.

A lot of the time there's a plot hole like this its just handwaved with Satan magic. Like why they think the evil doers leave clues to their intentions. Why? Because that kind of telling you what they are doing but not really is Satan magic!
313 329 0.0409964919090271 The reason is simple, those women (and most women) won't have sex with them. There can't possibly be something wrong with *them* so obviously something must be wrong with beautiful, popular, and/or famous women. If they're trans then that's the issue and they don't have to do anything close to introspection. I don't blame them for that bit honestly, taking a deep long look into the abyss that is their inner self must seem nightmarish on a good day.

These dense motherfuckers actually think the CIA gives a single fuck about "any group that's got more than a few hundred people." They'd lose their fucking mind with boredom if they ever saw what the typical CIA desk worker gets up to, let alone how they gonna "monitor and inflitrate" all these US centric groups while doing their *actual job* of dealing with other countries.

314 512 0.9869353771209717 there are 21,575 employees at the CIA. even if you ignore the fact that the CIA is almost exclusively focused on oversea operations, some extremely generous quick math. 335,000,000 americans means there is 1 cia agent for every 16000 americans. If EVERY american was part of ONLY 1 'group of 100 or more', that 155 groups for each CIA operative.

 In what fucking magical universe can a single CIA operative infiltrate and manipulate the leaders of 155 groups at a time. EVERY CIA operative. COMPLETELY ignoring literally every single other function the CIA serves.
314 512 0.9968177080154419 21,575 employees, but not even 21,575 analysts. A huge portion are gonna be HR, IT, Branch chiefs, janitor staff, etc. 

So it'd actually be even *more* per analyst, and thats assuming each analyst can "infiltrate" each group entirely from the office/online. If you need a field agent for each group, then I hope they have a teleporter.

339 354 0.9988309741020203 I wonder if every surveyed participant was asked every question. Because, even accounting for the fact that the survey takers admitted that people tend to overestimate small groups and underestimate large ones, we've got some odd results that don't add up. Most notably, 148% of Americans are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or Atheist.
339 355 0.9975357055664062 I just dont believe that anyone thinks 30% of the US population lives in NYC alone. I know it's a bit silly to refuse to accept the results of a survey without looking further into it, but these numbers can't be accurate. something is fishy.

  
Edit: one element here is that the medians and the "averages" (i assume they're referring to the means) are massively different for a bunch of these, viewable [here](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/41556-americans-misestimate-small-subgroups-population?redirect_from=%2Ftopics%2Fpolitics%2Farticles-reports%2F2022%2F03%2F15%2Famericans-misestimate-small-subgroups-population), at the original YouGov article on the survey.  These numbers still seem absurdly high, but the estimates of 10% transgender or 22% in New York seem at least plausible for someone to believe. Based on that, I'm assuming a few people put in troll responses (with 100% for everything, or for specific categories they thought would be funny) and the people at YouGov just didn't bother filtering them out, eother because they didn't notice or because they didn't care.

I actually think there's more in this one than a lot of the left like to admit. While I don't think a single thing is going to make any reasonable person do a  complete 180, people who've since left hate groups and extreme right wing movements always mention that they got into it because they were welcoming and supportive, and then were radicalized over time. And personal experiences and relationships are almost as often what gets them out.

Its probably not relevant in this specific case, but there are absolutely people in leftist/left leaning spaces who seem to be there to primarily drive others out. Either with "purity testing", pushing their pet issues, or just plain hostility which is toxic to movements based on community and consensus building. Its insanely frustrating that the most hateful and least inclusive movements seem to understand and practice this better (at least at a small scale).

383 561 0.3398786783218384 I mean, the statement you quoted is true though. Biden spent years saying that the rich get permanent tax cuts in the TCJA, and now he’s pivoted to saying he will let the tax cuts for the rich expire on schedule. He can’t have it both ways
383 561 0.7798643112182617 You can when both those things are true.

Corporate tax rates were permanently cut, and some other changes that affect how the wealthy make and retain money were as well. 

The personal income tax cuts, which affects a wider group will expire.  He's stated he wants to extend the cuts for people who earn than less than $400k.
383 561 0.9770002365112305 The truth has been that Biden’s been lying about the permanency of the cuts in the past. Corporations don’t receive a net tax cut past 2026 since the permanent corporate tax increases offset the permanent cuts. Conflating corporate cuts with “rich cuts” is also a bit of an odd conflation

If Biden had been honest about this from the beginning, it wouldn’t be as big of a deal now that he’s pivoting to letting the cuts expire

Uh....that's not how anything works. Tax cuts for the rich are skewed for the rich, because that's what words mean. You know you could increase taxes on the rich and cut taxes for the poor? That's also an option. So to claim that any and all tax cuts must benefit the rich more is just...impossibly stupid. And you're all over this thread talking down to people. It's pretty hilarious how you're both hyper-wrong and insanely smug about it.
386 561 0.9977249503135681 A bill raising taxes isn’t what we’re talking about though, we’re talking about bills that cut taxes across the board like the TCJA did. When you do that, the rich see most of the cuts, because they pay most of the taxes

Yeah, fair point.

Oak Hill, one of the areas wanting to break off, is one of the most wealthy areas in LA. I'd have to dig into census data to get a better, longer view but Wikipedia's breakdown has a recent increase in minority populations, so it definitely makes this a bit more likely.

There's a component of accelerationism in the modern right-wing extremism. I've literally heard some of these guys in private praise the mob. To them, the US is failed (for reasons...) and needs to be destroyed. Anything in furtherance of that is noble, so Capone, etc. and modern mobsters are sort of folk-heros like Robin Hood. It's weird. 

Their logic suddenly goes all contortionist when you bring up other gangs.

401 502 0.9981119632720947 There was some B-list gay celeb who had a child through surrogacy and these big tiktokers with millions of followers were straight up claiming the celeb had "purchased" the baby to "groom it".

401 460 0.9945472478866577 Hell, professional conservative shill and self-hating gay man Dave Rubin recently got a gift of two baby onesies from Ron DeSantis and when he tweeted about it, it was answered by the right-wing grifter sphere calling him a pedophile and a groomer who “stole babies from economically disadvantaged people”, as well as people referring to Rubin’s husband in quotes because those people don’t believe gay marriage is a valid marriage.

Like, if a conservative “darling” like Rubin gets that kind of hate for adopting and having a family, what kind of hell does other gay folk go through?

410 411 0.9981354475021362 The problem with RE5 wasn't that it was "a white guy killing black people in Africa". It was that it portrayed those black people as an insane stereotype, they were living in mudhuts and chucking spears at you.

But of course this is a discourse about race in gaming, no way was it ever going to be honest.

410 424 0.9982442855834961 Asmongold actually acknowledged that argument, and replied to it saying "I mean there are a lot of places in Africa that are fucking primitive." Is that wrong to a degree that the motivation to say so must be racist? You decide. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRcYpEpaQ1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRcYpEpaQ1I) at 7:42.

But a lot of people did jump the gun and think the issue was just shooting black people. While that's bad, (jumping the gun,) when IGN writes "Is Resident Evil 5 racist" and then "your primary targets are native Africans," it's no surprise people jump the gun and think this is the issue. Both the video commentary and the 2009 article mention "killing africans" after calling/insinuating that the game is racist. No, it's not OK to jump to a conclusion, but IGN didn't help with their wording - they could have simply said racist depiction was the problem. But it wouldn't have had the oompf if they would have done that. Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMY4LwVIypU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMY4LwVIypU) 4:20.

EDIT: IGN further continues to critique: "RE:5 positions Africa as the dark continent, an uncivilized world harboring a diseased population that needs gunning down by western intervention" ...of course the zombie virus infected people need to be gunned down? ...honestly, the article and the video commentary are both just a mess. IGN could have done this a hundred times better, and should probably stick to the game aspect more than the cultural one in the future.

411 421 0.9869194626808167 The whole yauske shit is both so insane and also a little worrying, like the chuds are now shouting down actual scholars, both western and japanese, talking about how yauske was real and was a samurai because the term samurai at the time period encompassed both the nobility leading a clan and the formal standing army the clan commanded, along with idiots trying (badly) to pretend to be japanese historians to deny basic facts anyone who studies the warring states period agrees on.

413 496 0.995501697063446 IVF is used for most surrogacy arrangements because most of those are gestational. So people get an egg from one of the intended parents or from an egg donor, fertilize with one of the intended parent's sperm or donated sperm, then transfer to a surrogate.

Many lesbian couples also use IVF. Most start with IUI, yes, but have to go to IVF for medical reasons (for example if their tubes are blocked, or they need/want to get the embryos tested for anything). Or they go to IVF because they want to do reciprocal IVF (rIVF) where the eggs are extracted from one mother, fertilized in the lab, and transferred to the other mother. That can enable both mothers to participate in the pregnancy but it can also be useful if one of them can't be pregnant for some reason but they want kids from the other's eggs or from both their eggs.

And the higher your age, the more likely your chances of success can be if you go with IVF. IUI is cheaper but if it doesn't work quickly enough, those costs still add up. So at a certain point, IVF can itself be cheaper, especially if you want more than one kid. Not to mention the cost of donor eggs or sperm.

415 443 0.999470055103302 No surprise there, Hasan is just a grifter too.

If his uncle worked at a right wing media org instead, he'd be Steven Crowder now.

415 538 0.9965640902519226 While I think you're right that's what they're (inexplicably) referring to from their post history and the sub they're posting in, the OOP actually didn't specify "behaviors" were or who they were referring to.

We can't participate in the linked threads, but if I could, their vagueness on that point would give me an opening to respond as if I'm assuming they're actually talking about anti-maskers.

My reply would be something like:

>"Yeah, it's really weird that people were so resistant to simply put on a mask and social distance to prevent the spread of a disease during a pandemic. So, I'm not sure what evolutionary mechanism led to that.

>I don't think that means they are literal demons though. In reality, humans are stubborn when they think they are being forced to do something, even if they should intrinsically want to do anyway to "love their neighbor".

This would force them on the defense to "correct my assumption" with whatever specific "behaviors" they actually mean. I'm honestly not sure what coherent response they would give to make their point though.

I believe whatever their response would be would prove they are the stubborn people I referred to.

At least in this hypothetical, I'd have given them credit for not being a demon...

I don't think the former set of opinions is noticeably less believable than the latter.
423 424 0.9870349764823914 Oh for sure, honestly I personally don't buy into RE:5 being racist, especially on purpose.

Though I think in the case of RE:5, a defense case is less credible given that, iirc, Chris is sent to Africa. An equivalent to AC, to me, would be, well, Sheva, a native agent (I think. It's been a while since I've played it), or even a white agent that was born and raised in Africa.

I think you also have to consider that "white savior" is an existing trope that RE:5 fits, and that trope is built on racism of previous eras, and the consideration that a stereotype is still a stereotype when it's true. For example, yes, there are bankers out there that are Jewish, but the Jewish banker is still a stereotype.
423 424 0.9870795607566833 Yeah, I wasn't happy with my comparison but I felt it was passable.


First time I hear about tropes like that, I don't use a lot of social media. I mean I've heard greed/money being connected to jews for sure. I don't like being so cautious about stereotypes, I feel like it'll have the opposite effect. I don't wanna acknowledge some racist's thoughts in a roundabout way because my savior is white or my banker is jewish. I suppose it could be different if I saw a lot of the trope everywhere, but I haven't noticed it, so I think I'll do more to promote the bad stereotype if I acknowledge it. That's my knee jerk reaction anyway, I haven't thought about it a lot.

And then you spend years attacking public education, making sure that you have enough idiots to not even see the glaring contradictions staring them in the face.

And that’s how you convince the masses to give away all their freedoms and to continuously vote against their own interests.

560 561 0.9960605502128601 It’s Congress and Biden’s decision on whether to extend the cuts or not. If they can’t come to a deal on it, it’s absolutely their fault
561 568 0.9994114637374878 House Republicans can't even pass a bill to name a post office currently. What makes you think they can pass any form of tax bill?

After all, according to the constitution, the house has to pass it before the senate can. So maybe they should stop sharing pictures of hunter's massive hog and do their fucking jobs for once.
561 568 0.9979999661445618 They’ve already written the bill, it’s called the TCJA permanency act
561 568 0.9963703155517578 Written isn't passed. They write a lot of bills. They wrote one this year that makes voting Democrat a felony. It also hasn't passed the house
561 568 0.9991650581359863 >Written isn’t passed

There’s no point in passing a bill that’ll get stuck in the senate, which would happen seeing as how not a single democrat voted for it when it was originally passed
561 568 0.9984081387519836 Maybe they should drop the dumbass policy they've had since newt was speaker of "no matter what the democrats want, we must oppose it, at the expense of the country"

Before newt, Republicans actually govern in good faith. They haven't at all since then. They made this bed of shit, they can either stay in it or choose to grow the fuck up and be Americans again. So far they choose to stay in their own bed of shit.
561 568 0.993751585483551 What exactly do you want them to do in order to get democrats to vote for the bill?
561 568 0.9979222416877747 They need to negotiate in good faith with the elected democrats. That's what they refuse to do. If they want elected democrats to support their bill, they need to move back to the center instead of saying "we demand maga based fascism or we kill you all".

The way it is now, if a member of the gop negotiates at all with democrats, they terrorist wing of the gop attempts to expell them. Ask Kevin Mccarthy, we saw how that played out. Even the current theologian that was made speaker was threatened with removal for not letting the US economy collapse like caveman green demanded.
561 568 0.9962863922119141 What attempt to negotiate have they done?

Saying "we gave them crumbs while we attempted to make permanent the biggest addition to national debt in us history" isn't negotiation. And it's especially not when that same party doing it blames democrats for the debt, despite nearly the entire deficit being from gop policy.

How do they plan to pay for it? Last I checked it included things like slashing social security, Medicare, education and childcare. Those are entirely non starters

So why should the democrats agree to vote for what is objectively a shit sandwich of a bill, with a side helping of complete economic collapse?
561 569 0.9995036125183105 Why do you fall for this obvious garbage? They wrote the bill to have the original tax cuts expire right when Trumps second term would have ended. This was to make it look like the Democrats raised taxes, when the next president came in. It's a stupid game that shows how little they actually care about you and your taxes. It's just a tool to buy your vote. And you fall for it so easily. If they believed that lower taxes make a better economy, then Trump and his admin should have made the cuts permanent in the first place. How can you blame Biden for Trump's expiration date?
561 569 0.9989959597587585 Wow, pretty much everything you said is untrue 

>right when Trumps second term would have ended 

12/31/25 is a full year into a new presidents term

>This was to make it look like the Democrats raised taxes 

It was because the bill was passed through budget reconciliation, which forces the bill to be deficit neutral after the 10-year budget window 

>Its a stupid game 

It was literally the only way to pass the bill since they didn’t have 60 votes (since no democrats voted for it)

>Should have made the cuts permanent in the first place 

If 10 democrats had joined, they could have. But again, the bill can’t include any tax cuts past 2027

Do you do any kind of research on topics before talking about them? How have you gone 6 years without knowing the most basic info about the bill you claim to hate?
561 569 0.8757864832878113 Yes, it expires during the first year of the next president. To make it look like they raised the taxes during their term. If the tax cuts can't go past 2027, then why were they set to expire in 2025?!!
561 569 0.9925432205200195 Budget reconciliation bills can only add an agreed-upon amount to the deficit within the 10-year window, which was $1.5 trillion for the TCJA. Keeping the cuts an extra 2 years would’ve pushed them past that limit
561 569 0.9984305500984192 You don't think they calculated how long it would take for that to happen? They knew the reconciliation rules, and used them to time when the cuts would expire. They could have made smaller cuts over a longer period and chose not to. Why do you suppose that is?
561 570 0.9990143775939941 The TCJA's cuts to people making less than 150k a year started expiring in 2018 and started to actually increase taxes in 2019 to that same group. 80% of americans got fucked by republicans and trump with this bill, and now people want to blame it on Biden, doesn't make a lick of sense to me.

561 578 0.9960663914680481 >Any tax bill has cuts skewed to the rich, because they pay the majority of taxes.

B does not follow A. It is possible to have tax cuts which impact mostly the non-rich.
561 580 0.9975417852401733 Did you even read the article? Or did you stop at the headline? Your own source acknowledges the 8-year individual tax cut, the exact same cuts that are republicans are now trying to extend 

The majority [did](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/business/economy/income-tax-cut.html) see tax cuts, whether they want to believe it or not
561 580 0.9989670515060425 Ah yes, linking to a paywalled article to prove your point. Your take lacks nuance. First of all, how many Americans are making the more than $200,000 a year that you need to make for many of the cuts to matter? Second, how many personal exemptions were eliminated that put that burden right back on to the middle class? It's easy to say there was a tax cut, but when you get rid of things that also keep personal taxes low, you didn't do a goddamn thing. But I get it, [nuance is hard.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/trump-white-house/fact-checking-and-analysis-of-trumps-state-of-the-union-2018-address/fact-check-massive-tax-cuts-to-the-middle-class/)

561 580 0.9965644478797913 What exactly are you arguing here? I want to say that you responded to the wrong person, because you didn’t address any of my actual points, you’re just creating strawman 

The fact that more of the cuts went to people who pay the most tax in no way means that others didn’t get a tax cut. Unlike your previous claim, the majority **did** see tax cuts, and that already includes the effects of the reduction in personal exemptions like you mentioned 

It really blows my mind how much people continue to lie and spread falsehoods about the TCJA, while simultaneously understanding nothing about it
561 581 0.9986720085144043 Since you're the only person that he lied to, maybe you should've called him out. Since he told them to you personally and all lmao.

"unrelated third parties" in a democracy are so called "voters". Maybe people 30 or 40 years could claim that they were unaware of climate change and its potential impact but not anymore. Not for the last 20 years or so. Most of these people - statistically speaking - keep voting for fossil fuel and car company lobbyists. So they are absolutely a legitimate target for a disruptive protest.

Are you genuinely dumb enough to believe that they are an organized voting bloc and that JSO can change literally anyone's mind by crashing a small local tourney and ruining people's nigjts for little to no reason? You might as well go crash a fucking 10 year old's birthday party and say its fine because "their parents are voters who support car lobbyists".

No, have I ever said that? Stop putting words in my mouth. You literally sound like every other liberal who thinks protests and actions should be like 3 guys in a basement standing silently in the dark.

Look at the protests in the past that have brought about meaningful change. They were all disruptive in one way or another. I bet you support them today, but given your attitude to the current protests, you would probably have opposed civil rights protests in the past.
699 700 0.9982885718345642 Saying that your targets need to actually be responsible for or contributing to climate change for you to protest against them for climate change is the absolutely bare minimum. Disrupting completely unrelated people for no reason does not help your cause at all. Its not even like blocking roads or bridges, which directly disrupt the supply chains the corporations causing climate change rely on, and other people are just collateral. You are just outright advocating for going after completely innocent orgs for no reason other than "it disrupts", having utterly no concern for whether it actually enacts any positive change.

They are contributing to climate change but that is different from claiming that this single event has a big impact on it. Literally nobody would claim that. You are just attacking strawmans. 

> Disrupting completely unrelated people

They are not unrelated if they live in a democracy...

700 701 0.9916821718215942 > I think protests tend to work better when you don't chase off the people you're trying to convince to join you.

You mean like making decades of academic research available to the public, doing TV interviews, going on radio shows, producing podcasts, high-quality educational video content, TV shows, writing newspaper articles and op-eds, writing books for all audiences from children to adults, like organising events and conferences, like going to schools to talk about it,  like peaceful protests, like protesting in front of government buildings, and disrupting the companies who pollute the most? - They've been doing that for decades, but the public just doesn't care. 

The advantage of these protests is that they actually expose all those people who would have previously claimed to be in favour of climate action. After all, who is going to give up something they have supposedly believed in for years because they were stuck in traffic for 30 minutes? I know who. People who know that ticking a box on a survey about being for the fight against climate change makes them feel good, but whenever they have a real chance to influence legislation every few years by voting for someone who is not in the pocket of big oil or the car industry, they give up because having free parking and cheap petrol outside their favourite bakery is more important to them than actually tackling the problem.

Certainly much more effective than the JSO protesters have been though.

Emotional people who would cut off their nose to spite their face. Aka, your average voter. The people you want on your side and need on your side if you're going to make a difference. It sucks, but pretending they don't exist will only hinder your goals.
700 701 0.9968569278717041 > Certainly much more effective than the JSO protesters have been though.

I'm not saying they haven't had an effect, but it shows that what you're saying they should do is just not enough. They have been doing all these things for decades and we are still missing our unambitious climate targets. I am frankly surprised that the protests are still so tame. Blocking cars and throwing paint at things? That's really nothing when you think about what's at stake.

> Emotional people who would cut off their nose to spite their face. Aka, your average voter. The people you want on your side and need on your side if you're going to make a difference. It sucks, but pretending they don't exist will only hinder your goals.

They not pretending they don't exist. It just seems to be an incredibly effective way of drawing clear lines about who is in which camp. Before, you might have assumed that there was a majority in favour of climate action - even if this was never confirmed in actual elections (which should have been a red flag years ago) - but now you know for sure that most people are against it, so you can potentially change your strategy.

Also, how many civil movements do you know from the past which were not disruptive in one way or another, and faced initially major opposition?

It hasn't been enough, but it is better than going backwards.

No. It's incredibly effective way to blur that line if anything.
700 701 0.9993064403533936 > It hasn't been enough, but it is better than going backwards.

We're not going backwards, they're just actually filtering out who's a real supporter and who's just supported it because it made them feel good, without any intention of actually doing anything about it.

How much would they have supported a climate policy that required them to actually change their lives if they were already giving up on it just by hearing about disruptive climate protests in the news or even being affected by them (i.e. waiting in traffic for 30 minutes, as they probably do every other day anyway)? 

> No. It's incredibly effective way to blur that line if anything.

No, the lines were blurred before. You always had this disconnect between polls showing that the majority of people were in favour of climate change action and election results. In my country it was even the most important issue for people for a while (supposedly), but you would never see that have an impact on an actual election.
700 701 0.9847301840782166 They're not filtering out anyone except potential allies man.

A lot more. A lot.
700 701 0.9951287508010864 > They're not filtering out anyone except potential allies man. 

They claimed to be allies until they were slightly inconvenient, although most people probably only heard about it on the news, so it didn't even affect their lives.

> A lot more. A lot.

I sincerely doubt that. Most people don't even do the small things they could do themselves, which could have a big impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions if all the people who support climate action did it, or another great example is all the opposition that cities face when they want to build some cycling infrastructure (i.e. draw a line on the street).

People "want" climate action, but it cannot in any way, shape or form have even a tangential impact on their lives. And that is simply impossible.
701 704 0.9964086413383484 Exactly. Nobody who follows world events even a little bit doesn’t understand that burning oil is a large contributor to climate change. 

The JSO people don’t help spread awareness to an already saturated audience. They just look stupid and give ammunition to people trying to make counter arguments while occasionally destroying irreplaceable things that their cause is purporting to want to protect.
701 703 0.9998059868812561 They're not potential allies. There are large groups in society who have no interest in taking steps to mitigate climate change or adapt to it if it causes them any inconvenience from their current lives, and trying to placate these groups is just wasting time. You're not going to convince someone who is willing to cross into attempted murder to avoid sitting in traffic for a bit longer than they were already.

741 746 0.9976963400840759 yes actually. That's how Tom Clancy found out so much about how the CIA and the US military operated in his early career, for example.

The CIA and the FBI and the military all published a lot of data (because they had to by law) that most of the people running the show didn't even realize (or at least comprehend how substantial the data was)

Clancy was a huge fucking nerd who got hyped reading that shit, which is why he "knew" all those "Secrets" when the CIA interviewed him. 

They had assumed that no one would be enough of a nerd to sift through all that boring ass data and technical manuals and shit, when in reality there was an entire culture of open source intelligence people pre-internet who were super into that. 

So yea, turns out a lot of "secret" stuff is secret because they assume no one will care to read it. Round about the late 80s/early 90s the various intelligence agencies of the world finally started realizing that Open Source Intelligence was actually, like, a thing and started not only investing in it but also running a lot of counter-intelligence operations against it (such as disseminating deliberate misinformation), but prior to that there was a hilarious amount of "Secret" stuff that was publicly available if you were willing to put in the time to read it.

Even now that's still extremely possible (and involves lots of the same boring sifting through oceans of technical manuals to learn valuable data) but you have to sift through a lot more misinformation to get at it. Most modern intelligence agencies even have entire departments just dedicated to harvesting open source intelligence from other nations, because basically open source intelligence is like a game of [mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game\)): You don't have to know the whole picture, you just have to know enough parts of it to assemble a reasonable approximation of the picture.
