# Social Network Analysis Project üìä

Welcome to my **Social Network Analysis** project repository! This project is part of the coursework for the **Social Network Analysis** class, where I analyzed social networks from different perspectives: 

1. **Facebook Pages Food Dataset** - Analysis of a pre-existing dataset.
2. **Reddit Scraper and Sentiment Analysis** - Data extraction from Reddit using Python's `praw` library.
3. **Individual Presentation Report** - Social Network Analysis in Natural Disaster Response and Recovery
   
## üìÅ Project Components

### Part 1: Dataset Analysis (Facebook Pages Food Dataset)
In this part, I analyzed the **Facebook Pages Food** dataset which can be found [here](https://networkrepository.com/fb-pages-food.php). The analysis was focused on:
- Full network analysis of the dataset.
- Creation of two artificial networks:
  - A **Random Network** (Erdos-Renyi model)
  - A **Scale-Free Network** (Barabasi-Albert model)
- Comparison between the real dataset and the artificial networks.

#### Analysis:
- **Detailed Description:** Network size, type, and significance.
- **Network Properties:** Average degree, diameter, connected components, shortest paths, and clustering coefficient.
- **Distribution Plots:** Degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and connected component size.
- **Most Important Nodes:** Identification based on various measures.
- **Visualization:** Provided visual representations of the network structure.

### Part 2: Real Data Analysis (Reddit Scraper)
For the second part of the project, I developed a **Reddit Scraper** using Python's `praw` library to collect real-time data. This data was then analyzed and represented as a network. Key aspects of this project include:
- **Data Acquisition:** Extracted data from Reddit using a scraper.
- **Network Representation:** Nodes represent users or posts, and links are based on interactions (comments, upvotes, etc.).
- **Network Analysis:** Applied centrality measures, degree distribution, and clustering coefficients.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Performed sentiment analysis on the scraped posts to determine general user sentiment in discussions.

## üìë Individual Presentation Report

I also conducted a **research study** on the application of **Social Network Analysis** in the context of **Natural Disaster Response and Recovery**. This paper examines real-world disaster events and analyzes the evolution of social networks in aiding disaster response.
